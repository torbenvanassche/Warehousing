## Story and Lore
The player is a creature tamer that can control all kinds of different creatures. However, for the purpose of this game and to protect us from expanding too much this is limited to controlling a single type [[Creatures|Creature]], at first this being limited to a [[Creatures#Slime|Slime]]. Later on, either as part of this game or expanding the world further (potentially for future games) we can add other creatures that each provide their own function.
## Item spawner
Randomly spawning items is the first important element of the gameplay loop. These items are generated at random, and each of them is defined with a pre-defined shape. These shapes are then used by the player to puzzle them together into a container.
## Item requests
Equally as random as the item spawner can spawn items, the item requests come in at random intervals during the day. In Addition to that, certain items can only spawn as part of events that are unique and have a unique item associated with that event.
## Puzzle
As each item has a shape associated with it, so does each container that is used to ship the items. The shape of the box is always rectangular but can vary in size. The player has to fit the item they are carrying into the container box, then repeat the process until the box cannot hold more items. Each box has a cost associated with it, each item that is placed into it will grant the player points/money to compensate them for being efficient in the way they fit everything into the boxes. 

> An example is a box with 3x3 dimensions that costs 9 coins, where each filled slot providing 1 coin with an additional reward for filling up all 9 slots. This to encourage people to fill the box as much as possible to optimize their profit.
